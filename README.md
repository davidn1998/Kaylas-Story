# Kayla's Story Demo

A demo for a 2D adventure platformer I'm working on.

By going to Assets/Scripts you can view all of the scripts that I have for the demo.

### Note

The code should be mostly commented but there may be quite a bit of overhead that I'm currently trying to refactor and optimise.
